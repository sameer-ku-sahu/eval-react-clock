packages/react-clock/README.md

First, ensure you're in the react-clock package directory

```
cd packages/react-clock
```

Start the watch script to automatically rebuild the package when you make changes

```
yarn watch
```

Open a new terminal window. Navigate to either the test or sample directory, which contains a demo application using react-clock. For this example, let's use the test directory

```
cd test
```

Start the development server for the test application
```
yarn dev
```
